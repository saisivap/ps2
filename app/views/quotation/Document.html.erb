<hr>

<h3>7.Offline Alternatives</h3>

<p>There is an alternative that going to TimeOut cafe and we can have an order mouth order as per the rash you may get the cafe/sandwich or which item do you need .but it depends on the rash in that cafe but by using my application, you can see the orders having booked before and you can go their and you fix the time to get that coffee or you like item.</p>
<hr>



<h3>8.Online alternatives</h3>

<p>There is no any application for TimeOutCafe in AIT .So there is no any online alternatives to solve the time waster of waiting to have coffee or any item in a cafe.I think my application may fix the problem with showing the latest orders that their are before we order and we can fix the time to have a coffee or any items which the TIMEOUT CAFE provides. </p>
<hr>
<h3>9.Magnet Content</h3>

<p>The main magnetic content of my application is the posts posted by the shopkeeper and the customer posts by having the items.We share our original review as a posts in the application and one thing is about saving time. </p>
<hr>
<h3>10.DNS and HOST Name Registration Procedures</h3>

<p>TimeOutAit.com is our main hostname for our application.Now mainly this application for AITans who is facing problem to have snacks during break time,and also the cafe is present in the AIT itself.So for now we would like to host this web application in AIT server.  There are several options for DNS registration, such as BlueHost, GoDaddy, etc. All these domain name registrars provide domain names for purchase. Once our user base has also increased, we could also scale our servers to Amazon, Azure, etc.</p>

<h3>12.All social Web applications have users, content, and some kind of user-to-content map. Specify what kind of information each of these areas will have in your application.</h3>

<p>In our Application we have users ,items and admin information and we also have booking information of the customer and our application also contains the pictures of the users if they upload and will have mainly the items pictures and the prices of the particular item. </p> <hr>
<h3>13.SQL injection</h3>
<p>This page lists many query methods and options in ActiveRecord which do not sanitize raw SQL arguments and are not intended to be called with unsafe user input. Careless use of these methods can open up code to SQL Injection exploits. The examples here do not include SQL injection from known CVEs and are not vulnerabilites themselves, only potential misuses of the methods.</p>
<hr>
<h3>14.Sensitive Data Audit</h3>

<p>For this, you need to encrypt data before it’s sent to the database. This is known as application-level encryption. Use storage-level encryption for all data and application-level encryption for sensitive data.There’s a popular gem called attr_encrypted that integrates nicely with Active Record.
  The production database password is not stored anywhere on the server or in the repository. It is set only once during the setup of the production server and this is done by an environment variable.As usually we has devise gem it automatically hash the password and adds salt to it so this also very useful for developers.</p>
